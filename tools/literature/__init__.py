Literature tools: find a paper, then get its text in a form worth reading.

  **Find it.**  ArxivSearchTool searches arXiv (ids, PDF links, abstracts).
                The INSPIRE bundle covers HEP metadata and citations, and has
                no arXiv access or retrieval of its own.

  **Read it.**  ArxivSourceTool fetches the LaTeX e-print, which is the best
                input for reading a paper's equations because they survive
                intact. Where arXiv has no source, PDFToTeXTool reconstructs
                TeX-faithful text from the PDF instead -- symbols,
                sub/superscripts, fractions and radicals come back as TeX
                macros rather than being flattened into characters that no
                longer say what they meant. FetchPaperPDFTool retrieves the
                PDF that tool reads.

IMPORT COST. The arXiv tools need only `requests`, which is a base
dependency; the PDF path needs pypdfium2, the literature bundle's one pip
dep. tex_extract imports pypdfium2 at module scope, so importing it eagerly
here made `import tools.literature` -- and with it every arXiv tool -- fail
outright on a base install, for a dependency those tools never touch.

The PDF names are therefore resolved LAZILY (PEP 562). On a base install the
package imports, the arXiv tools work, and PDFToTeXTool still resolves (it
imports pypdfium2 inside the method that needs it, so only CALLING it fails);
pdf_to_tex and page_to_tex raise ModuleNotFoundError on first access, naming
what to install. The failure is scoped to the thing that actually needs the
dependency.
