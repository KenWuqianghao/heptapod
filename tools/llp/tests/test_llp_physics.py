Unit tests for the LLP physics primitives, above all the UNBIASEDNESS of the
decay-vertex sampler under a hard downstream cut.

This is the regression test for the 2.4.0 bug. `sample_decay_vertices` used the
fixed stratum midpoint u_k = (k + 1/2)/K, which is a midpoint QUADRATURE rule,
not stratified sampling. A quadrature rule carries O(1) error whenever a
discontinuity falls inside a panel, and the downstream geometry supplies
exactly one: an LLP counts only if its parent decayed upstream of the absorber,
a window covering the first ~2% of the exponential for a forward kaon. With
K = 6 the estimator was low by FIVE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE near the strong-coupling
edge, and -- because the nodes were deterministic -- re-running with a different
seed reproduced the same wrong answer exactly. Seed variation, the usual check,
is blind to it.

The tests below compare against the CLOSED FORM, which is the only check that
would have caught it.
